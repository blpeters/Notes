# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

A programming philosophy that arose because of the increasing complexity of code bases and software. The complexity made it difficult to maintain, and small changes would have large ripple effects throughout the code.

### Encapsulation

Hiding pieces of functionality or code and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base. Helps prevent data from being manipulated or changed unintentionally.

### Polymorphism

Ability for different types of data to share a common interface, and allows flexibility in using pre-written blocks of code as building blocks for new purposes with some of the same functionality.

### Inheritance

Where a class inherits the behaviors of another class (superclass). Helps programmers to set up basic classes with the minimum functionality common to subclasses. Allow the subclasses to inherit this functionality and then build more detailed functionality off the superclass.

### Mixin

The inclusion of a module in with a class using `include` is called a mixin. This allows the behaviors of the module to be available to the class and its objects

## Objects
